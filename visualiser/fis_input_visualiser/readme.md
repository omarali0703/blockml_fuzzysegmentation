# Visualiser
> This file contains a processing script that allows you to visualise the segmentations in a 3-dimentational graph. This better helps visualising the clusters of particular training sets. If you fancy finding better information/dataset types for training the FIS, this would be a great tool to determine the fitness of the set.

## Usage
> Change line 11 in the fis_input_visuliser.pde to the path of your .dat file containing the boundary, left and right cohesions, and the disimilarity.
> This can be generated using micrologic functions pertaining the *rs3trainingdata*.
> **Data needs to be in RS3 format unless you want to do it manually.**
